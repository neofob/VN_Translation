<center>American's Edge - Lợi thế Hoa Kỳ - Anne-Marie Slaughter</center>

Foreign Affairs - January/February 2009

Tóm tắt: Khả năng độc đáo của Hoa Kỳ lợi dụng các mối
liên hệ sẽ làm thế kỷ 21 này là thế kỷ Hoa Kỳ.

Anne-Marie Slaughter là Khoa trưởng Công chúng và Ðối Ngoại
của trường Woodrow Wilson.

Chúng ta sống trong một thế giới nối kết.  Chiến tranh
là nối kết: sức mạnh của quân khủng bố và quân đội
sẽ đánh bại chúng dựa vào các nhóm chiến binh nhỏ và cơ
động nối kết với nhau và các mạng lưới tình báo, thông
tin và hỗ trợ.  Ngoại giao là nối kết: giải quyết khủng
hoảng quốc tế -- từ SARS (triệu chứng hô hấp cấp tính
nặng) cho đến biến đổi khí hậu -- đòi hỏi sự huy động
các mạng lưới quốc tế cả bên công cộng lẫn tư nhân.  Kinh
doanh là nối kết: tất cả sổ tay hướng dẫn cho tổng giám
đốc CEO ấn bản trong thập niên vừa qua đều tập trung vào
sự chuyển hướng từ thế giới mang cấu trúc hàng đứng
sang thế giới mang cấu trúc hàng ngang của các mạng lưới.
Giới truyền thông là nối kết: blog trực tuyến và các phương
tiện tham gia dạng khác dựa vào đóng góp từ độc giả để
tạo một cuộc đối thoại nối kết to lớn. Xã hội là nối
kết: thế giới MySpace là tạo ra thế giới toàn cầu của
"OurSpace"(1) , nối kết hàng trăm triệu cá nhân xuyên lục địa.
Ngay cả tôn giáo cũng là nối kết: như mục sư Rick Warren chỉ
rõ "Thứ duy nhất đủ bao trùm để giải quyết các vấn nạn
của sự trống trải tinh thần, tính lãnh đạo ích kỷ, nạn đói
nghèo, bệnh tật, và ngu dốt là mạng lưới gồm hàng triệu
nhà thờ trên toàn cầu."

Trong thế giới này, thước đo của quyền lực là tính
kết nối.  Gần 30 năm trước, nhà tâm lý học Carol Gilligan
viết về sự khác biệt của hai phái về cách thức suy nghĩ.
Bà quan sát rằng đàn ông có khuynh hướng nhìn thế giới
như được cấu tạo bằng thứ bậc của quyền lực và tìm
cách leo lên vị trí tối cao, trái lại phụ nữ có khuynh hướng
nhìn thế giới như được cấu tạo bởi các mạng lưới của
các mối liên hệ và tìm cách tiến vào trung tâm.  Những quan
sát của Gilligan có thể là chức năng của giáo dưỡng hơn là
bản tính vốn có; dù gì đi nữa, hai cái nhìn bà ta nhận ra
tóm gọn sự khác biệt giữa thế giới của thế kỷ 20 và thế
kỷ 21.

Nhà khoa học chính trị Arnold Wolfers mô tả thế giới của
thế kỷ 20 là, ít ra trong bối cảnh ngôn ngữ của địa chính trị,
thế giới của bi da, như một hệ thống của các quốc gia
tự chủ va chạm với nhau.  Hệ quả của những va chạm này
được quyết định bởi sức mạnh quân sự và kinh tế.
Thế giới này vẫn còn tồn tại cho đến nay:  Nga xâm lấn
Georgia, Iran theo đuổi vũ khí nguyên tử, Hoa Kỳ củng cố
quan hệ với Ấn Ðộ nhằm tạo phên giậu chống lại Trung
Quốc trỗi dậy.  Ðây là cái mà Fareed Zakaria, biên tập
viên Newsweek International, gán cho tên gọi "thế giới hậu
Hoa Kỳ", mà trong đó sự trỗi dậy của các cường quốc
vô hình chung chắc chắn có nghĩa là sự ảnh hưởng của
Hoa Kỳ tương đối giảm đi.

Thế giới kết nối đang thành hình trong thế kỷ 21, tuy nhiên,
tồn tại ngoài, trong, và xuyên quốc gia.  Trong thế giới này,
quốc gia có nhiều kết nối nhất sẽ là nhân vật chính có thể
sắp đặt nghị trình và mở ra sáng kiến và phát triển lâu dài.
Ðây là điểm mà Hoa Kỳ có lợi thế rõ ràng và xác đáng.

<center><b>Chân Trời Hy Vọng</b></center>

Lợi thế của Hoa Kỳ nằm sâu trong dân chúng, địa dư, và
văn hóa.  Hoa Kỳ có dân số tương đối nhỏ, chỉ khoảng
20-30 phần trăm so với Trung Quốc hay Ấn Ðộ.  Dân số ít
hơn cho phép Hoa Kỳ phát triển và gặt hái từ kỹ nghệ
năng lượng dễ dàng hơn.  Ðồng thời sự đa chủng của
dân Hoa Kỳ cho phép Hoa Thịnh Ðốn mở rộng ra toàn cầu.
Ðể đi đến mục đích này, Hoa Kỳ nên xem những cộng đồng
dân nhập cư là những đường liên kết sống động về
ngược quê nhà của họ và khuyến khích dòng đối lưu gia đình,
sản phẩm, và tư tưởng.

Hoa Kỳ là điểm neo của Tây bán cầu, một vùng rộng mở bao
gồm Châu Phi, Châu Mỹ, và Châu Âu.  Những quốc gia dẫn đầu
ở Tây bán cầu thái bình, ổn định, và đa dạng về kinh tế
hơn so với những quốc gia ở Á bán cầu.  Tuy nhiên, Hoa Kỳ
đồng thời là sức mạnh then chốt có thể hưởng lợi cùng
lúc từ vị thế ở Tây bán cầu và từ ràng buộc sâu rộng với
Á bán cầu.  Ðại tây dương và Thái bình dương đã từ lâu
bảo vệ Hoa Kỳ khỏi xâm lăng và can thiệp chính trị.  Chẳng bao lâu,
chúng sẽ che chở Hoa Kỳ khỏi xung đột gây ra bởi biến đổi
khí hậu như đang từng giảm thiểu ô nhiễm đang đến Hoa Kỳ.
Hoa Kỳ có cấu trúc xã hội tương đối theo hàng ngang -- cho dù
nó đã trở thành tôn ti hơn với sự gia tăng thu nhập bất bình
đẳng -- cũng như văn hóa doanh thương và phát minh.  Những
đặc tính này là lợi thế tuyệt vời trong nền kinh tế toàn
cầu ngày càng được thúc đẩy bởi những nhóm liên kết của
những người sáng tạo nhất thế giới.

Vào 20 tháng Giêng 2009, Barack Obama sẽ bắt đầu hồi phục lại
uy tín quyền lực của nước Mỹ.  Thế giới kết nối mang lại
một chân trời hy vọng.  Trong thế giới này, với các chính sách
thích hợp, di dân có thể là suối nguồn của việc làm hơn là
tháo tiêu tài nguyên, có thể nối kết quê hương mới với
thị trường và các nhà cung cấp ở quê cũ.  Doanh nghiệp ở Hoa
Kỳ có thể điều phối mạng lưới các nhà sản xuất và cung
cấp toàn cầu.  Người tiêu thụ có thể mua sắm tại chỗ,
bắt nguồn từ sự hồi sinh của các nền kinh tế nông sản và
doanh thương chuyên biệt hoá, từ bất cứ nơi nào cùng lúc
khắp thế giới có thể quảng cáo trực tuyến.

Vào năm 2000, công ty Procter & Gamble ra quyết định làm tái tạo
cách thức công ty hoạt động vào thế kỷ 21.  Thay vì cố giữ
lấy các công thức của họ từ xà bông cho đến chip khoai tây,
Procter & Gamble chọn trình làng hồ sơ các sáng chế của họ, gần
như ai cũng có thể có công thức nếu họ trả phí bản quyền.
Ðồng thời họ yêu cầu các nhà quản lý hàng đầu đem phân nửa
các ý tưởng từ bên ngoài công ty cho các sản phẩm và dịch vụ
mới.  Hiện giờ họ trông cậy đến những nhóm nhà sáng chế
dàn trải toàn cầu và trực tuyến, nơi các nhà phát minh giao du
ở các website như InnoCentive, một website đấu giá ý tưởng
chẳng hạn.  Don Tapscott và Anthony Williams, tác giả của Wikinomics:
Hợp tác đám đông thay đổi mọi thứ như thế nào, gọi cách
kinh doanh như InnoCentive là "chợ tư tưởng"(2), những quảng trường
công cộng thời hiện đại nhằm kết giao những người muốn bán
ý tưởng của mình với doanh nghiệp đang muốn mua chúng.  Vào năm
2006, Samuel Palmisano, người đứng đầu IBM, dự đoán trong bài
viết trên rằng các tập đoàn sẽ đi từ đa quốc gia, với bản
sao bé nhỏ của chính chúng cho mỗi thị trường, sang cái mà ông
ta gọi là "các tổ chức kinh doanh toàn cầu".  Ngày nay, IBM xé
lẻ các công việc cho bất cứ nơi nào mà chúng được làm tốt
nhất.

Hãy xét đến trường hợp của Li và Fung, công ty lớn nhất và
thành công nhất về xuất khẩu nguyên liệu.  Khách hàng của họ
là các nhà bán lẻ hầu hết tất cả các mặt hàng được con
người biết đến, hay ít nhất làm bởi con người.  Nhiệm vụ
của <i>Li và Fung</i> là tìm ra các nhà cung cấp từ trên 40 nước
khắp thế giới và kết nối họ với nhau nhằm thực hiện đơn
đặt hàng.  Kết quả các mạng lưới này phải nhanh chóng, uyển
chuyển, và phải đạt một tiêu chuẩn chung cao.  Theo William và
Victor Fung, hai người chủ hiện thời của kinh doanh gia đình, bí
quyết của cung cấp nguyên liệu là "điều phối các mạng lưới".
Ðiều này tương đương như bên quản lý về việc tạo ra một hệ
thống mà anh có thể chọn điểm đến trên bản đồ tàu điện
Paris và thấy một đường đi khả dĩ lóe sáng lên với các mạng
kết nối từ nhiều đường đi màu sắc khác nhau -- ngoại trừ,
dĩ nhiên rồi, người đi tàu ở mỗi ga có thể có ý kiến riêng
họ như thế nào là đường đi tốt nhất.

Trước tiên, những mạng lưới toàn cầu này trông như chỉ là

At first, these global webs may seem to be just the next generation of
outsourcing. But something much deeper is going on. Outsourcing requires
a central command that specifies precisely what and how much should be
produced and then, through an established hierarchy, communicates those
decisions to producers in multiple nations. In contrast, under a system of
peer production, supply chains become "value webs," in which suppliers become
partners and, instead of just supplying products, actually collaborate on
their design. Boeing is a particularly striking example, given how it could
be seen as the heart of old-style manufacturing. It has shifted from being
simply an airplane manufacturer to being a "systems integrator," relying on
a horizontal network of partners collaborating in real timẹ They share both
risk and knowledge in order to achieve a higher level of performancẹ It is
not simply a change in form but a change in culturẹ Hierarchy and control
lose out to community, collaboration, and self-organization. At its core,
a company can be quite small, often no more than a central node of leaders
and manager-integrators. But with the right networks, it can reach anywhere
innovators, factories, and service providers can be found. In this world,
as Tapscott and Williams write, "only the connected will survivẹ"

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), too, have realized the power of
connections. An early example was the International Campaign to Ban Landmines,
which began in 1991 as a coalition of six NGOs from North America and
Europẹ It eventually grew to include over 1,100 groups in some 60 countries,
and with this breadth came clout. After it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997,
the network successfully pushed for a global treaty banning the use of land
mines (although China, Russia, and the United States, among others, have
refused to sign it). NGOs pursuing other causes have followed suit. In 1995,
a small group of human rights organizations began calling for the creation
of an international criminal court to try war criminals. They succeeded
in convincing governments to establish a permanent court in 1998. Today,
the Coalition for the International Criminal Court includes over 2,000
organizations from every corner of the world, which are now working to expand
the court's jurisdiction. More recently, a global alliance of NGOs has been
instrumental in pushing for action to stop the ongoing violence in Darfur.

In each of these cases, NGOs gained leverage over otherwise reluctant
states. They formed transnational networks that multiplied their lobbying power
and put their message on the agendas of international institutions. As Francis
Sejersted, then chair of the Nobel Committee, noted when he recognized the
land-mine campaign, "The mobilisation and focusing of broad popular involvement
which we have witnessed bears promise that goes beyond the present issuẹ It
appears to have established a pattern for how to realise political aims at
the global level."

Governments have been slower to understand twenty-first-century challenges
and to reform themselves accordingly, but they, too, are gradually moving
toward a more networked structurẹ A report entitled The Embassy of the
Future, issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
2007, calls for ỤS. diplomats to be "decentralized, flexible, and mobile,"
as well as "connected, responsive, and informed." ỤS. embassy staff would
have a more "distributed presence," both virtually and physically, if they
worked at multiple locations and with a wide range of different groups in
their host countries.

Similarly, Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control,
realized after the anthrax scare in 2001 and the SARS crisis in 2002 that
the CDC needed to create a network of public and private actors from around
the world. Managing this network would, in turn, require a much more flexible
and horizontal organization at the CDC's headquarters, in Atlantạ Gerberding
was expected to get results but lacked the authority necessary to produce
them. For Gerberding, the solution was to find partners around the world
and to connect them in ways that would allow for the creation and sharing
of knowledge during a crisis. Many judges and government regulators have
had a similar insight. Bankruptcy judges, for example, now communicate with
one another around the world, signing agreements to manage together the
bankruptcies of multinational corporations. The current financial crisis
could have been even worse if the world's central bankers had not already
been connected and able to coordinate their actions.

Power can also flow from connections across different sectors. In his book
Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making, David
Rothkopf explains how leaders connect across different power structures, from
the worlds of business and finance to those of politics and the arts. "In
fact," he writes, "such linkages are as distinguishing a characteristic
of the superclass as wealth or individual position." In other words, it
is connectivity, more than money or stature, that determines individual
power. This dynamic can even extend to terrorist groups such as al Qaedạ John
Robb, a former air force colonel and military strategist, has observed that
Mohamed Atta was the leader of the 9/11 hijackers because, although no formal
hierarchy existed in the group, "Atta had twenty-two connections to other
people in the network, much more than any other, which gave him control of
the operation."

The power that flows from this type of connectivity is not the power
to impose outcomes. Networks are not directed and controlled as much as
they are managed and orchestrated. Multiple players are integrated into
a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts -- an orchestra that
plays differently according to the vision of its conductor and the talent
of individual musicians. Obamás team-based campaign, with its relatively
flat structure and emphasis on individual organizers, is a model of the
twenty-first centurýs management stylẹ

Most important, networked power flows from the ability to make the maximum
number of valuable connections. The next requirement is to have the knowledge
and skills to harness that power to achieve a common purposẹ The United States
is already following this model in a few specific ways. In combating terrorism,
it has been able to stop planned attacks thanks to a dense global network
of law enforcement officers, counterterrorism officials, and intelligence
agencies. The ỤS. government dramatically improved its standing in the
Muslim world due to its swift and effective relief effort in Asia following
the December 2004 tsunamị It coordinated an emergency-response strategy among
government agencies and aid workers in Australia, India, Japan, and the United
States itself. More recently, when the global financial crisis hit this past
fall, the United States first reached out to central banks around the world
to coordinate a monetary response and then reached out to central banks in
key emerging markets to make sure their foreign currency needs were being met.

From this vantage point, predictions of an Asian century -- such as those
made by Kishore Mahbubani, a foreign policy scholar and dean of the Lee Kwan
Yew School of Public Policy, in Singapore -- seem prematurẹ Even Zakariás
argument about "the rise of the rest" takes on a different significancẹ If,
in a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power but centrality
in an increasingly dense global web, then the explosion of innovation
and entrepreneurship occurring today will provide that many more points
of possible connection. The twenty-first century looks increasingly like
another American century -- although it will likely be a century of the
Americas rather than of just Americạ

MORE PEOPLE, MORE PROBLEMS

Demography is often cited as the chief factor behind the relative decline of
the West. China and India make up over a third of the world's population, while
Europe and Japan are actually shrinking and the United States is suđenly a
relatively small nation of 300 million. This argument, however, rests largely
on assumptions formed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Throughout
most of human history, territory and population translated into military and
economic power. Military power depended on the number of soldiers a state could
put into the field, the amount of territory an enemy had to cross to conquer
it, and the economýs ability to supply the statés armỵ Population size
mattered for economic power because without trade a state needed a domestic
market large enough for manufacturers and merchants to thrivẹ With trade,
however, small mercantile nations such as the Netherlands and Portugal
were able to punch far above their weight. In the nineteenth century, to
increase their power, small countries expanded their territory through
colonization. But by the twentieth century, as political unrest in the
colonial world grew, the advantages of trading rather than ruling became
increasingly clear. Although the United States and the Soviet Union, two
great continental powers, dominated the second half of the twentieth century,
the countries that grew the richest were often the smallest. In 2007, the
ten countries with the highest per capita GDPs all had populations smaller
than that of New York City, with one notable exception: the United States.

In the twenty-first century, less is morẹ Domestic markets must be big
enough to allow national firms to obtain a foothold so as to withstand
international competition (although such markets can be obtained through
free-trade areas and economic unions). But beyond this minimum, if trade
barriers are low and transportation and communication are cheap, then size
will be more of a burden than a benefit. When both markets and production
are global, then productive members of every society will generate income
across multiple societies. Business managers in one country can generate value
by orchestrating a global and disparate network of researchers, designers,
manufacturers, marketers, and distributors. It will remain the responsibility
of government, however, to provide for the less productive members of society,
namely, the elderly, the young, the disabled, and the unemployed -- think
of them as national overhead costs. From this perspective, the 300 million
citizens in the United States look much more manageable than the more than
a billion in China or Indiạ

A shrinking population can actually act as a catalyst for innovation. In China,
the answer to many problems is simply to throw people at them -- both because
people are the most available commodity and because the Chinese government
needs to provide as many jobs as possiblẹ In Japan, by contrast, the answer
is to innovatẹ Nintendo, the Kyoto-based gaming giant, is bringing much
of its manufacturing back to Japan from China and other parts of Asiạ How
can it possibly compete using high-cost Japanese labor? It will not have to
-- its new factories are almost entirely automated, with only a handful of
highly skilled employees needed to run them. This approach uses less energy,
costs less, and guarantees a higher standard of living for the Japanese
population. As the priority shifts from economic growth to sustainable growth,
the formula of fewer people plus better and greener technology will look
increasingly attractivẹ

Finally, size carries its own set of political challenges. Over the past
four centuries, the arrow of history has pointed in the direction of national
self-determination. Empires and multiethnic countries have steadily divided
and subdivided into smaller units so that nations, or dominant ethnic groups,
could govern themselves. Ninety years after Woodrow Wilson laid out his
vision of self-determination for the Balkan states, the process continues in
Kosovọ In many ways, the breakup of the Soviet Union was another round of the
decolonization and self-determination movement that began in the 1940s. It
continues today with the conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well
as with the potential for conflict on the Crimean Peninsula and in eastern
Ukrainẹ Much of Chinás 5,000-year history has been a saga of the countrýs
splitting apart and being welded back together. The Chinese government,
like the Indian government, legitimately fears that current pockets of
instability could quickly translate into multiple secessionist movements.

The United States faces no threats to its essential unity, which has been
forged by a political and cultural ideology of unity amid diversitỵ The
principal alternative to this ideology is the solution employed by the
European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
in which individual states come together as larger economic and, gradually,
quasi-political units. The most promising dimension of recent Chinese politics
has been its adoption of a version of this solution with regard to Hong Kong
and Macao -- and one day Beijing may apply this model to Taiwan.

The United States benefits not only from its limited population but also
from who makes up that population. It has long attracted the world's most
entrepreneurial, creative, and determined individuals. A vast mixing of
cultures has created an atmosphere for a fruitful cross-fertilization and
innovation. These arguments still hold. In San Francisco, for instance,
a new municipal telephone help line advertises that it can talk with
callers in over 150 languages. This diversity, and the creativity that it
produces, is visible everywhere: in Hollywood movies, in American music,
and at ỤS. universities. At Princeton University this past fall, five of
the six student award winners for the highest grade point averages had come
from abroad: from China, Germany, Moldova, Slovenia, and Turkeỵ

In the nineteenth- and twentieth-century era of nation-states, the United
States absorbed its immigrants and molded them into Americans, thereby
creating the national cohesion necessary to build military and economic
strength. Today, diversity in the United States means something morẹ Immigrant
communities flourish not only in large cities but also in smaller towns and
rural areas. A mosaic has replaced the melting pot, and, more than ever,
immigrants connect their new communities to their countries of origin. Along
the southern border of the United States, for instance, immigration experts
talk about "transnational communities," about clusters of families in the
United States linked with the villages of Mexico and Central Americạ Now,
where you are from means where you can, and do, go back to -- and whom you
know and trust enough to network with.

Consider, for example, how valuable the overseas Chinese community has been
to Chinạ Alan Wang, a former student of mine, was born in China, moved
to Australia with his family at the age of 12, and went to college and law
school therẹ He later came to the United States to pursue a graduate degree
at Harvard. For a while, he practiced law with a large British firm in London,
and then moved to its Shanghai officẹ When I asked him how he identified
himself, he replied, "overseas Chinesẹ" Millions of people similar to
Wang have spread out from China throughout Southeast Asia, Australia, the
United States, and Canada, creating trading and networking opportunities
for people in all those places. Similarly, the United States must learn
to think of its ethnic communities as the source of future generations of
"overseas Americans." Already, young Chinese Americans and Indian Americans
are heading back to their parents' homelands to seek opportunity and make
their fortunes. Soon, the children of ỤS. immigrants from Africa, Asia,
Latin America, and the Miđle East will follow a similar path and return
to their ethnic homelands, at least for a timẹ The key to succeeding in a
networked economy is being able to harvest the best ideas and innovations
from the widest array of sources. In this regard, the United States is
plugged into all corners of the global brain.

Beyond its immigrant communities, the United States can also depend on a new
generation to forge connections around the world. John Zogby, the influential
pollster, calls Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 "the First Globals,"
a group he describes as "more networked and globally engaged than members of
any similar age cohort in American historỵ" More than half of the respondents
aged 18 to 29 in a poll conducted in the United States in June 2007 by Zogby
International said that they had friends or family living outside the United
States, vastly more than any other ỤS. age group. Other Zogby polls have
shown that this generation holds passports in roughly the same proportion as
other age groups but uses them far more frequentlỵ A quarter of this group,
according to Zogbýs data, believes that they will "end up living for some
significant period in a country other than Americạ"

These young people spreading out around the world will be a huge asset to
the United States. Children born abroad who acquire ỤS. citizenship as
a result of their parents' heritage or life decisions will ađ to this
number. A college classmate of mine was born to Hungarian immigrants in
Canada and later acquired ỤS. citizenship. After graduation, he moved to
China and then Japan, where he gained a Japanese residency permit while also
applying for Hungarian citizenship. He now lives with his Chinese wife in
Beijing, where his daughter was born. Not long after her birth, he took her
to Tokyo so that she could register as a ỤS. citizen and reenter China on a
ỤS. passport. These stories are legion in any large global city -- couples
from two different countries who are raising their children in a third or
fourth or even fifth countrỵ For many people who orbit in this floating
cloud of nationalities, a ỤS. passport, particularly now that the United
States has relaxed its rules on dual citizenship, has become a new kind of
reserve currencỵ With one, even the most venturesome and peripatetic have
the guarantee of the political and cultural stability of the West. The United
States must devise the incentives and conditions that will allow it to both
encourage this phenomenon and profit from it.

THE WORLD IS ROUND AGAIN

For most of modern history, the Eurocentric view of the world has placed
North and South America in a hemisphere of their own -- the Western
Hemispherẹ Today, the world is mapped in the round, with Asia in the East
and Africa, the Americas, and Europe in the West. That, at least, is how
some Asians increasingly think of themselves. In his recently published book,
The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East,
Mahbubani argues that the era of "Western domination of world history is over"
and that the world is witnessing an "Asian march to modernitỵ"

But if half of the world is now "the East," defined as the Asian hemisphere,
then the other half is the Atlantic hemisphere, made up of Africa, the
Americas, and Europẹ It is quite a promising neighborhood, home to a wealth
of human, economic, material, and natural resources. Politically, Europe
and North America constitute a spreading community of liberal democracies
that accounts for one-sixth of the world's population, almost 60 percent of
global GDP, and the two primary global reserve currencies. More trade and
direct investment pass over the Atlantic Ocean than any other part of the
world -- over $2 trillion in cumulative foreign direct investment alonẹ The
potential for further integration of the hemisphere is enormous.

Even more important is the potential for deeper economic integration within
the Americas. On energy questions, Canadian oil sands and Brazilian sugar cane
are more promising than depending on Russian pipelines or Sudanese oil. Markets
for renewable energy -- such as from biomass, wind, geothermal technology, and
other sources -- are growing in Latin Americạ Miami is already a financial
center for Latin America, and the steady growth of the Latino population
in the United States will only deepen intra-American investment. The rise
of Brazil and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Mexico will create an emerging
counterbalance to the United States south of its border. But any initiative
for strengthening economic ties must come from the United States itself. It
first must ađress its immigration policy and then, similar to the economic
and political assistance it provided to the European Union, offer support
for an economic union in Central and South Americạ The result could be an
integrated market and trading bloc of 800 million people, with tremendous
natural resources, enormous opportunities for development and sustainable
growth, and deep ties to Africa, Asia, and Europẹ

That market would still have the protection of two wide oceans, and even in
a networked world, there are benefits in being disconnected. Those oceans
protect the United States against massive refugee flows, against other
threats to security from civil and interstate wars, and, increasingly, from
the effects of climate changẹ Researchers at Princeton University have found
that rain over the Pacific Ocean washes out of the air substantial amounts of
ozone and some other gases emitted in Asia before the air can ever get to the
Americas. Most climate-change projections forecast rising waters overflowing
the deltas of South and Southeast Asia, potentially threatening millions
of lives in countries such as Bangladesh. Increasing desertification in
northern Africa will force emigrants across the Mediterranean and into Europe;
a similar process in northern China could push even greater numbers into
Russiạ Conflict is likely to follow these displaced peoples. New democracies,
such as Indonesia, and one-party states, such as China and Vietnam, will find
themselves economically and politically vulnerablẹ Of course, the Americas
will not be fully protected from rising oceans, flooding, desertification,
or the other nasty consequences of climate changẹ Still, both geography
and demography -- and the absence of hundreds of millions of people on the
move -- will insulate the New World from the afflictions of the Old.

A CULTURE OF CREATION

A nation's economic fate depends on its being able to maintain and nurture
innovation. This past year, all the ỤS. presidential candidates made repeated
calls for a renewal of the conditions that had long made the United States
the world leader in innovative technologỵ In the twenty-first century,
corporations, civic organizations, and government agencies will increasingly
operate by collecting the best ideas from around the globẹ In such an
environment, it is critical not only to stimulate domestic innovation but also
to foster networks that can produce collaborative innovations across the globẹ

To this end, the United States needs to improve education and increase
government investment in science and technologỵ But the most important
ỤS. edge in innovation is cultural. Fundamental flaws in Chinás political
and economic systems will make it very difficult for China to move from
being the world's factory to being the world's designer. The Chinese
government is determined to develop innovation as if it were developing
a fancy variety of soybeans, relying on industrial parks that mix equal
parts technology, education, research, and recreation in self-described
"talent highlands." The results can be extraordinary, as I saw last year
at the Shanghai Zizhu Science-Based Industrial Park. The park, built in
just five years, has enormous university campuses, research headquarters
for over 20 Asian and Western firms, and a residential complex. The aim is
to inspire innovation through a balance of nature, science, and ecology, or,
as its planners suggest, to create the "building blocks" for a future Chinese
society, just like the building blocks for a new generation of skyscrapers.

The park is awe-inspiring. "In China," our guide told us, "anything is
possiblẹ" Looking at the pace, scale, and quality of the construction, it
was quite possible to believe it. In the end, however, the Zizhu industrial
park struck me as being similar to an aquacultural facility for manufacturing
cultured pearls. But as all pearl lovers know, the richest innovations are
created through unexpected and irregular irritations, not tightly controlled
conditions. In 2003, the University of California alone generated more patents
than either China or Indiạ That same year, IBM generated five times as
many patents as both countries combined. The problem is certainly not a lack
of creativity on the part of Chinese or Indians; Silicon Valley is full of
entrepreneurs from both groups. The issue is the surrounding culture, or what
the urban studies theorist Richard Florida calls an "innovation ecosystem."

At the same time that China is seeking to maintain political tranquility,
it depends on continued growth powered by innovation, which requires conflict
-- not violent conflict but positive, or constructive, conflict, the kind of
conflict that produces non-zero-sum solutions. This is the kind of conflict
found on American playing fields, in American courtrooms, and in the American
political system. It is the conflict of structured competition, in which losers
have a chance to win another day and everyone has a stake in continually
improving the gamẹ It is also the conflict of creative destruction, the
process of destroying old business models to make way for new ones.

Most important, a culture of constructive conflict rewards challenging
authority in every domain. Perhaps the best example is Google, a company
in which hierarchy is almost nonexistent. Individuals are encouraged to go
their own way, come up with their own ideas, and counter orthodoxies at every
turn. In the United States, educational institutions have long emphasized
critical thinking in ways that China and other countries are now trying
to emulatẹ But a culture of innovation requires more than the ability to
critiquẹ It requires saying what you think, rather than what you believe
your boss wants to hear, something many Western managers struggle fruitlessly
to encourage in Chinạ A culture that requires a constant willingness to
reimagine the world is not one that the Chinese Communist Party is likely
to embracẹ Indeed, a culture of innovation requires the encouragement
of conflict within a larger culture of transparency and trust, placing a

THE WORLD OF WIKIS

Starting with Alexis de Tocqueville, nearly every observer of American
culture has noted that Americans are inveterate joiners, volunteers, and
debaters. Today, however, instead of sewing circles, debating societies,
and charity bake sales, Americans have MySpace, blogs, and the Clinton
Global Initiativẹ These qualities are evident in a growing number of
collaborative enterprises, both online and off. In the world of wikis,
perhaps best exemplified by Wikipedia, ideas are challenged, edited, and
challenged again. The final product is the result of a different and gentler
kind of adversarial process than that found in the ỤS. legal system. But
the premise is the same: multiple minds clashing and correcting one another
in pursuit of the truth. The work of one contributor is open and available
for others to usẹ Participants in this process are trusted to not take
advantage of that openness but instead ađ their own contributions.

In a world that favors decentralization and positive conflict, the United
States has an edgẹ Although trust and transparency are not unique to the
United States, it is still one of the most open societies in the world. The
Internet world, the wiki world, and the networked world all began in the
United States and radiated outward. The characteristics of those worlds are
the keys to innovation and problem solving in the twenty-first centurỵ

In his book Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Robert Wright, a senior
fellow at the New America Foundation, writes of human history as a steady
process of increased exposure to complexity and the resulting ability to
turn zero-sum problems into non-zero-sum solutions. The barbarian invasions
that swept across Asia and Europe, for instance, were disastrous for many
individual societies. Yet by ađing new ideas and practices to the sum of
human knowledge, the invaders spurred the process of innovation and problem
solving. In other words, they brought progress. Today, the invaders are online
rather than on horseback, and interaction is considerably more voluntarỵ The
benefits will flow to those individuals and states that are most comfortable
reaching across cultures. It will become increasingly necessary to appreciate
and absorb contributions in any language and from any context.

Here, however, the conventional wisdom depicts Americans as woefully ignorant
of foreign geography, languages, and cultures. Many Americans may still
fit this description. But many others -- immigrants and their children
especially -- negotiate cultural differences every day in their schools,
in their workplaces, and on the street. From Boston to Los Angeles, recently
immigrated Africans, Arabs, East Asians, Latinos, South Asians, and Southeast
Asians all rub shoulders with members of more established communities, both
black and whitẹ At the elite level, the top graduate schools in the United
States offer a similar education in multicultural competence; many of the
cross-cultural couples who are changing the face of global cities met at
places such as Harvard and Stanford. Obamás parents may have been ahead of
their time, but today far more young Americans than ever before are following
their examplẹ They are truly, as Zogby calls them, "the First Globals."

HOW TO GET THERE FROM HERE

At the moment, the United States' edge in this new world is more potential
than actual. The country will face a vast amount of work in digging itself
out of the many holes it has gotten itself into, both at home and abroad. In
the process, the United States must adopt five policies and postures that
will seize on its edge and sharpen it.

First, the United States must adopt comprehensive immigration reform that
will make it easier for immigrants and guest workers to move across borders,
regularize the status of the millions of illegal immigrants currently in
the United States, and increase the number of visas for the world's most
talented individuals. Part of changing ỤS. attitudes toward immigration must
include a recognition that because of their ties to their home countries,
immigrants are potential engines of economic growth. New economic policies
could offer subsidies or tax incentives to immigrants who create businesses
based on connections they have cultivated to markets and talent in their
home countries. Instead of a one-way, outgoing flow of remittances, the
United States needs a two-way flow of goods, services, and peoplẹ

Second, as part of overhauling its educational system, the United States must
come to see overseas study as an essential asset for all Americans. Indeed,
organizations such as the BrownBell Foundation promote opportunities to study
abroad for students at historically black colleges and universities, where
such programs have traditionally been lacking. Just as important, the United
States must see the children of immigrants who grow up learning Arabic, Hindi,
Mandarin, Spanish, and other foreign languages as huge assets. Government
programs and private initiatives should encourage them to study abroad in
the countries of their parents or grandparents and, assuming they keep their
ỤS. passports, to gain dual citizenship.

A networked world requires a genuinely networked society, which means fostering
economic and social equalitỵ The United States has never been as egalitarian
as it imagines itself to be, but this divide has worsened in the past decade,
as the rich have become the superrich. Between the late 1950s and 2005,
the income share of the wealthiest one percent of the ỤS. population more
than doubled. Even the Democratic Party is not immune: on the night that
Obama accepted the nomination to be the Democratic presidential candidate,
at Invesco Field in Denver, Colorado, his campaign blocked off an entire
section of the stadium for big donors, stopping everyone else at the door. For
a time, a culture in which money could buy status was a radically democratic
and egalitarian ideạ Instead of the European class system, in which breeding
always trumped money, Americans could rely on education and employment for
self-advancement. But this same culture becomes radically inegalitarian
if only a relatively few have the chance to prosper financiallỵ As the
political scientist Larry Bartels argues, rising economic inequality is a
political choice: Republican presidents have generally allowed inequality to
expand, whereas Democratic presidents have not. If so, then the United States
can choose to decrease inequality by making its society more horizontal,
more democratic, and more integrated by class and race -- and this is the
third reform it should adopt. Doing so would ađ more potential circuits to
the network.

Fourth, in foreign policy, the United States should put more effort toward
engaging Latin America -- not at the expense of its ties with Asia but in
ađition to the strong history of transpacific relations. Brazil, for example,
defines its foreign policy in terms of concentric circles. It starts with
Mercosur, the South American trading bloc, then continues to Latin America,
the Americas, and then the rest of the world. Similarly, the United States
should think in terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
Americas before turning to the rest of the world. The potential for growth
and development in the Americas is enormous. Population links between the
United States and Latin America are strong and growing stronger. Spanish
is now taught in virtually every American public school from the early
grades. Strengthening ties with Latin America also means cultivating links
across the South Atlantic to Mediterranean countries such as Spain and
Portugal, and also to France and Italỵ Lastly, African blood runs in the
veins of many North, Central, and South Americans. This fact is the legacy
of a ghastly institution, but it means that many Americans have an African
heritage that can allow them to reconnect with Africa todaỵ

More generally, the United States must learn to see both itself and the
world differentlỵ If power is derived from connectivity, then the focus of
leadership should be on making connections to solve shared problems. This
approach is not only a different leadership style than that which has
prevailed in the United States in recent years but also a fundamentally
different concept of leadership. In contrast to the way it is in a hierarchy,
in this concept of leadership a single leader cannot be directly in charge
of everyone elsẹ Different countries can mobilize diverse coalitions for
specific purposes. Regional powers, for example, can ađress crises in
their particular parts of the world: consider Australiás role in promoting
stability in East Timor, ASEAN's ability to convince the Myanmar government
to accept foreign aid after Cyclone Nargis, or Turkeýs work in pushing for
talks between Syria and Israel. The range and complexity of foreign policy
challenges -- and the speed with which a crisis can escalate -- mean that
knowing the right people to call and the right levers to pull in any corner
of the world must be a key element of ỤS. diplomacỵ

Finally, the United States must recognize the necessity of orchestrating
networks of public, private, and civic actors to ađress global problems. The
era of government formulating and executing policy entirely on its own is over,
even with a revitalized ỤS. government that has a greater social and economic
mandatẹ Outsourcing government functions to private and civic contractors is
not the answer, however; government officials must instead learn to orchestrate
networks of these actors and guide them toward collaborative solutions.

SHARPENING THE EDGE

In this century, global power will increasingly be defined by connections --
who is connected to whom and for what purposes. Of course, the world will
still contain conflict. Networks can be as malign and deadly as they can
be productive and beneficial. In ađition, the gap between those who are
connected to global networks and those who are excluded from them will
sharply multiply existing inequities.

But on the whole, the positive effects of networks will greatly outweigh
the negativẹ Imagine, for example, a ỤS. economy powered by green
technology and green infrastructurẹ Communities of American immigrants
from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Miđle East will share
this new generation of products and services with villages and cities
in their home countries. Innovation will flow in both directions. In
the United States, universities will be able to offer courses in truly
global classrooms, relying on their international students and faculty to
connect with educational institutions abroad through travel, the Internet,
and videoconferencing. Artists of all kinds will sit at the intersection
of culture, learning, and creative energỵ ỤS. diplomats and other
ỤS. government officials will receive instant updates on events occurring
around the world. They will be connected to their counterparts abroad, able
to quickly coordinate preventive and problem-solving actions with a range
of private and civic actors. The global landscape will resemble that of the
Obama campaign, in which a vast network brought in millions of dollars in
donations, motivated millions of volunteers, and mobilized millions of voters.

In a networked world, the United States has the potential to be the most
connected country; it will also be connected to other power centers that are
themselves widely connected. If it pursues the right policies, the United
States has the capacity and the cultural capital to reinvent itself. It need
not see itself as locked in a global struggle with other great powers; rather,
it should view itself as a central player in an integrated world. In the
twenty-first century, the United States' exceptional capacity for connection,
rather than splendid isolation or hegemonic domination, will renew its power
and restore its global purposẹ
